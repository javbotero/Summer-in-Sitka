### About

Sitka is a small Alaska community in the heart of the world’s largest temperate rainforest, perched on the North Pacific, set among mountains and glaciers.

Sitka isn’t just scenery. You know how we spend our lives trying to find love with someone else? That’s plenty important, of course! But what about finding love with place? People in Sitka love where they live — unabashed, star-crossed, Romeo-with-Juliet romance — that creates a closeness of community that will warm even the most frayed, threadbare spiritual fibers of your soul. This is why people fall in love with Sitka.

Over 150 students have come to Sitka the last four years. You can too. There is the [Historical Restoration Work Crew](work-crew.html) and year-long [Winter Fellowships](winter-fellowships.html) for graduates. Plus, there’s the [Sitka Fellows Program](http://www.islandinstitutealaska.org/programs/sitkafellows).

Sitka is not for everyone. The weather won’t remind you of Miami. Also unlike Miami: Sitka is on an island. The only way in and out is by Alaska Air, Delta, or [ferry](http://www.anchoragepress.com/news/rite-of-passage/article_cf032b58-46a2-5bc7-bf1b-1582736f5fe4.html). Or by floatplane or [fishing](http://sealaska.tumblr.com/page/2) [boat](http://vimeo.com/50592758). There are wonderful hole-in-the-wall coffee shops that boil their own bagels, but there aren’t any Starbucks — and for goodness sake, there’s no J. Crew.
