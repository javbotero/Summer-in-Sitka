#### Sitka Winter Fellows (2015-2016)

College is over! Life begins. What’s next?

Sitka Winter Fellowships are the natural evolution of summer Bulldogs on Baranof opportunities. For first-ever year of the program, from September 2014 through May 2015, 12 recent college grads (nine of whom are Yalies) are living in community in 105-year-old [North Pacific Hall](http://fineartscamp.org/facilities/north-pacific-hall/), cooking in a communal kitchen, working for local organizations, becoming immersed in the lovely community of Sitka, Alaska. While Sitka Winter Fellowships are funded fellowships, they are about a rich, meaningful experience, not money.

The Winter Fellowship includes: a $150/week stipend for food and incidentals; a $500 stipend to defray the cost of travel to and from Sitka; your own room in North Pacific Hall and the use of communal facilities (living room, kitchen, bathrooms, etc.) shared with other fellows; access to all facilities on the [Sheldon Jackson Campus](http://fineartscamp.org/facilities/); the opportunity to live with eleven other wonderful young people, become part of a wonderful Alaska community, and explore the mountains and ocean and wilderness of Southeast Alaska.

Rolling admissions/notification: applying sooner is better than later.

Testimonials from 2014-’15 Winter Fellows:

_I don’t think I’ve ever used the phrase “life-affirming” before, but it seems applicable here. Moving to Sitka for the Winter Fellows program has been a totally life-affirming decision. I feel seen, valued, and supported in every aspect of my life._

_At work, I’m an important member of a small team. I’m expected to direct my own projects and think analytically about problems when they arise. My big-picture and small-picture ideas are taken equally seriously, and if they’re good, I get the chance to put them into practice._

_At home, my housemates/fellowfellows teach me things like how to drive stick shift, bake bread, use bear spray, be a better person, think more critically about politics, make potato soup, and run far without hurting my knees._

_In Sitka at large, I’m always bumping into colossal generosity. A bunch of strangers band together to help find a stolen bike, and it’s returned within the week. A family opens their home to twelve twenty-somethings on Thanksgiving. A fisherman drops off fifty pounds of free Alaskan salmon (this really happened!!) and then says we should just let her know when we run out, and she’ll bring more. It’s crazy that I lucked into this life. You should definitely apply for this fellowship._

And:

_I took multiple college classes that sough to answer the question: what is the good life? If only the philosophers and psychologists I studied could have visited Sitka, AK. It would have saved me and them a good amount of time._

_We were welcomed to Sitka with boat rides to Forest Service Cabins tucked away in wooded inlets, with potlucks, 70lbs of donated salmon, invitations to family dinners, and offers to provide us with “whatever we needed.”  The community has a persistent generosity: in the months since we arrived, the invitations have kept coming, and our fish stock has been restocked._

_I can see the ocean from my bedroom–a view that regularly features magnificent sunsets.  I live minutes away from trails that lead to alpine ridges and spectacular views.  And I share this experience with eleven other fellows that I treasure. We hike together, go out together, have family dinner every week, followed by games. Communal living situations don’t always work– but here in Sitka they seem to do well. And when they do well, there is nothing better._

_During the week I serve at a wellness center, working for the most positive and energetic people I have ever met.  The nonprofit provides for the health of more than 700 members.  I do everything from building maintenance, to managing the rock climbing wall,  customerservice, and accounting.  In short, I feel like I make a difference.  I am given real responsibilities. I am challenged, I sometimes fail, but learn an incredible amount, and am given the agency to define my own work._

_On sunny days, I kayak during my lunch breaks. Since late October I have shared the Sitka Sound with pods of humpback whales. I have seen more rainbows in three months here than during the rest of my life.  I watch sea otters from the parking lot of the grocery store. I play on the mountains or in the ocean every weekend. I run on trails to waterfalls or up mountains, watch hundreds of salmon fight their way upstream, and some nights get to witness natures greatest light show._

_If this all sounds too good to be true, I understand. I have been here for over three months, and I still feel that way. I am still in awe of the 360 degrees of beauty, and I am perpetually grateful for the community. I can imagine nothing better to do right after college because no matter what career I eventually find myself in, I will be able to look back on this experience and remind my self that life can be like this. Life should be like this._
