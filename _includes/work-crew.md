#### Historic Restoration Work Crew

Think Habitat for Humanity by weekday, and full-time Alaska adventuring (kayaking and backpacking, ocean and Alaska alpine) by three-day weekend.

The Historic Restoration “Work Crew” is a scrum of adventure-loving 20-somethings — originally students from Yale, but now students from around the country and the world — who come to Sitka for four weeks to help restore a century-old National Historic Landmark, the [Sheldon Jackson Campus](http://fineartscamp.org/facilities/).

Sheldon Jackson Campus is a former college campus that has become a petri dish to grow awesome programs in the arts, sciences, and humanities; it’s basically the physical plant of a college campus that exists for the sole purpose of making cool ideas happen.
While the campus has become a nexus of creative and cultural energy (symposiums, lectures, concerts, scientists- and artists-in-residence, music festivals, arts camps), it’s also 100-plus years old and needs lots of TLC. Thousands, both from Sitka and far beyond, have banded together to tend to the campus with thousands of hours of TLC to restore the campus. That’s what the Work Crew is: four days a week, restoring turn-of-the-twentieth-century architecture and furthering the righteous cause of the campus, and for the three-day weekend, exploring Southeast Alaska to the fullest and most adventurous extent possible with other wonderful people hailing from colleges across America.
